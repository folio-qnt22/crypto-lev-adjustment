Volatility is defined as Volatility = (H-L)/O.
The code simply calculates the leverage based on the volatility of your benchmark coin.
Here we use BTC as a benchmark. 

To change the parameter, go to the function *lev_adjustment*

    BTC_volatility = 0.12 # value of (H-L)/O at the period where you perform the best 
    SL_best = 0.7  # value of the SL at the period where you perform the best
